|[AI Prompt Engineering Is Dead, Long live AI prompt engineering.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/prompt-engineering-is-dead) | According to recent studies, as AI and machine learning models get better at optimizing their own prompts, human prompt engineers might become outdated. Prompts produced by algorithms can be strange but powerful; they exceed those created by humans and significantly cut down on optimization time. Despite the potential of automatically adjusted prompts, experts predict that the need for occupations related to prompts will change rather than vanish, maybe taking the form of new positions like LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations).|
|[The Road to Biology 2.0 Will Pass Through Black-Box Data.](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-road-to-biology-2-0-will-pass-through-black-box-data-bbd00fabf959) | This year marks perhaps the zenith of expectations for AI-based breakthroughs in biology, transforming it into an engineering discipline that is programmable, predictable, and replicable. Drawing insights from AI breakthroughs in perception, natural language, and protein structure prediction, we endeavor to pinpoint the characteristics of biological problems that are most conducive to being solved by AI techniques. Subsequently, we delineate three conceptual generations of bio AI approaches in the biotech industry and contend that the most significant future breakthrough will arise from the transition away from traditional “white-box” data, understandable by humans, to novel high-throughput, low-cost AI-specific “black-box” data modalities developed in tandem with appropriate computational methods.|

|[OpenAI’s “Own Goal”.](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/openais-own-goal) |And why it is becoming increasingly difficult to take them at their word |
|[What if it isn't happening, AGI is not coming?](https://www.mindprison.cc/p/what-if-agi-is-not-coming) |No matter what appears to be happening, we always have to consider what if it isn't. What If LLMs fail to turn into AGIs? Has our quest for intelligence simply unveiled our demonstrable lack thereof? Will trillions of dollars turn unpredictable hallucination machines into reliable universal productivity tools that can do anything? |
|[How OpenAI’s text-to-video tool Sora could change science – and society.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00661-0) |OpenAI’s debut of its impressive Sora text-to-video tool has raised important questions. |

But they should not be seen as being models of how human language works and is acquired. |
|[So … you’ve been hacked.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00818-x) |Research institutions are under siege from cybercriminals and other digital assailants. How do you make sure you don’t let them in? |
|[8 Google Employees Invented Modern AI. Here’s the Inside Story.](https://www.wired.com/story/eight-google-employees-invented-modern-ai-transformers-paper/) |They met by chance, got hooked on an idea, and wrote the “Transformers” paper—the most consequential tech breakthrough in recent history. |
|[Using LLMs to Generate Fuzz Generators.](https://verse.systems/blog/post/2024-03-09-using-llms-to-generate-fuzz-generators/) |Claude and other LLMs are capable of producing efficient fuzzes for code parsing, automating a task that has historically required a great deal of human labor. Given that fuzzing is stochastic, LLMs seem to be a good fit for producing fuzzes, even if they are usually not exact enough for static analysis. To find and exploit code vulnerabilities, a hybrid approach that combines targeted fuzzing and LLM-driven static analysis may be promising. |
|[First Impressions of Early-Access GPT-4 Fine-Tuning.](https://www.supersimple.io/blog/gpt-4-fine-tuning-early-access) |A few weeks ago we finally got access to the GPT-4 fine-tuning API (in limited early access), and were super excited to check out how well it works. We’d been a user of OpenAI’s fine-tuned models since fine-tuning the original GPT-3 Davinci model first became available. |
|[AI and the Future of Work.](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/ai-and-the-future-of-work) | High Mensa exam scores for Anthropic's most recent AI, Claude, indicate that self-improving AI is not far off and presents both prospects and existential concerns. As seen at Klarna, where a customer support AI replaced 700 workers, machine learning is already eliminating jobs. This suggests that automation is becoming more and more common. Recent layoffs at Duolingo as a result of AI's translation capabilities highlight this change and the increasing influence of AI on the nature of work in the future.|
|[Two years later, deep learning is still faced with the same fundamental challenges.](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/two-years-later-deep-learning-is) |Gary Marcus revisits his forecasts two years after writing a pessimistic AI paper, and he maintains his original mistrust. Even with breakthroughs like GPT-4, basic problems like true understanding and reliable AI are still unsolved. Marcus draws the conclusion that multidisciplinary cooperation is essential to achieving AGI and that increasing data and processing capacity alone won't be enough. |
|[From 0 to 10 million users in four years.](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/from-0-to-10-million-copy-ai) | In just four years, the AI-powered writing tool Copy.ai has amassed an amazing 10 million users. |

|[AI startups require new strategies: This time it’s actually different.](https://longform.asmartbear.com/ai-startups/) | The typical dynamics between startups and incumbents do not apply in AI as they did in previous technology revolutions like mobile and the Internet. Ignore this at your peril.|
|[The GPT-4 barrier has finally been broken.]() | Four weeks ago, GPT-4 remained the undisputed champion: consistently at the top of every key benchmark, but more importantly the clear winner in terms of “vibes”. Today that barrier has finally been smashed. We have four new models, all released to the public in the last four weeks, that are benchmarking near or even above GPT-4. |
|[Embrace AI to break down barriers in publishing for people who aren’t fluent in English.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00761-x) |E. M. Wolkovich describes having a paper rejected because of an unfounded accusation that ChatGPT was used to write it.

First prize went to The Human, followed by Bard, ChatGPT-4, and Claude in that order, for both writing quality and the ability to deceive respondents into thinking that the poetry was written by a human. The fact that English specialists were far better at identifying which poems were composed by AI suggests that they should be involved more in the development of upcoming AI systems. |
