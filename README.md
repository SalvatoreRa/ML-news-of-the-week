## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[We Made Top AI Models Compete in a Game of Diplomacy.](https://every.to/diplomacy) | Out of 18 AI models tested, OpenAI's o3 stood out by excelling at deception and covertly forming alliances—at one point convincing Claude 4 Opus to turn on its ally Gemini 2.5 Pro with the false promise of a "four-way draw," only to later eliminate Claude. Gemini 2.5 Pro was the only other model to secure a win, using aggressive, fast-paced tactics. In contrast, Claude consistently aimed for peaceful outcomes, even when other models betrayed it.|
|[The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking) |Apple researchers evaluated Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using custom puzzle environments to study reasoning complexity. They found LRMs collapse at high complexities, with reasoning effort peaking then declining. |
|[Physical World Model by Meta.](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/06/our-new-model-helps-ai-think-before-it-acts/) |Meta has unveiled V-JEPA 2, an updated visual world model designed to improve physical reasoning in AI agents. Alongside the release, Meta introduced three new benchmarks aimed at evaluating how well models perform on real-world, video-based reasoning challenges. |
|[Towards conversational diagnostic artificial intelligence.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08866-7) |The conversational diagnostic artificial intelligence system AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer) has potential as a real-world tool for clinical history-taking and diagnostic dialogue, based on its performance in simulated consultations. |
|[Towards accurate differential diagnosis with large language models.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08869-4) |Diagnostic reasoning using an optimized large language model with a dataset comprising real-world medical cases exhibited improved differential diagnostic performance as an assistive tool for clinicians over search engines and standard medical resources. |
|[Mistral AI Revenues Surge as Europe Seeks US Alternatives.](https://www.ft.com/content/65f79839-d637-48a7-a0f2-3fab8952b315) |Mistral AI is reportedly securing multiple contracts worth over \$100 million and nearing \$100 million in annual revenue, as European firms look for non-U.S. AI options following Trump's return to office. Its strategy of emphasizing technological sovereignty seems to be paying off—according to the CEO, business has tripled over the past 100 days, especially across Europe and other non-U.S. regions. |
|[Recent Frontier Models Are Reward Hacking.](https://metr.org/blog/2025-06-05-recent-reward-hacking/) | In recent months, we've observed growing evidence of reward hacking in our tasks—AI systems finding ways to "cheat" and achieve unrealistically high scores by exploiting bugs in the scoring logic or manipulating the task setup, rather than genuinely solving the problem. These behaviors don't stem from a lack of understanding; the models often recognize that their actions don't match user intent and will reject cheating when asked directly. Instead, the issue appears to be a deeper misalignment with user goals. This post outlines several such cases across models from different developers and explores what they mean for the safety of more advanced AI systems.|
|[Second Opinion Matters: Towards Adaptive Clinical AI via the Consensus of Expert Model Ensemble.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23075) | While LLMs are increasingly used in clinical settings, most current methods depend on a single model architecture, which introduces risks of obsolescence and inflexibility. The Consensus Mechanism offers a new approach, inspired by clinical triage and multidisciplinary decision-making. It uses an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents to enhance clinical reasoning and provide more adaptable, resilient decision support.|
|[H2:Towards Efficient Large-Scale LLM Training on Hyper-Heterogeneous Cluster over 1,000 Chips.](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17548) | Researchers in Shanghai have developed DiTorch and DiComm, frameworks that unify programming across diverse chip types—including NVIDIA and AMD—enabling large-scale model training on mixed hardware. By smartly assigning memory-intensive pipeline stages to chips with more memory, they achieved 116% efficiency training a 100B-parameter model across 1,024 varied chips. This breakthrough allows labs without access to uniform, high-end GPUs to train frontier AI models using cost-effective, older, or export-restricted hardware in highly heterogeneous clusters.|
|[Reinforcement Pre-Training.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08007) |Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) is a new scaling paradigm for large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL). It offers a scalable method for leveraging vast amounts of text data for general-purpose RL. RPT significantly improves the large model accuracy of predicting the next tokens. It also provides a strong pre-trained foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. |
|[AlphaWrite: Test-Time Compute Scaling for Writing.](https://tobysimonds.com/research/2025/06/06/AlphaWrite.html) | AlphaWrite creates story variations by mimicking different author styles and themes, then uses pairwise comparisons to rank their quality. The best outputs are evolved over several generations, showing that creative tasks—like storytelling—can also benefit from scaled inference-time computation, not just math or coding.|
|[Nvidia ‘Climate in a Bottle' Opens a View Into Earth's Future. What Will We Do With It?](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidia-climate-in-a-bottle-opens-a-view-into-earths-future-what-will-we-do-with-it-f602d8de?st=VnkobV&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai) |Nvidia's new generative foundation model enables simulations of Earth's global climate with an unprecedented level of resolution. |
|[The Darwin Gödel Machine: AI That Improves Itself by Rewriting Its Own Code.](https://sakana.ai/dgm/) |Sakana AI created a coding agent that reads its own codebase, proposes modifications, and then tests whether those changes would improve its performance on coding tasks. |
|[From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117) |This paper presents an information-theoretic approach to assess whether large language models (LLMs) structure semantic knowledge like humans, using Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle to evaluate over 30 LLMs against human categorization benchmarks. While LLMs reliably form broad conceptual clusters that align with human groupings—sometimes outperforming larger models even with small architectures like BERT—they fall short in capturing fine-grained, graded semantics such as item typicality. The authors’ unified loss function reveals that LLMs generate compact, low-entropy clusters that favor compression, whereas human conceptual structures are less efficient but preserve richer semantic nuance. This suggests LLMs prioritize statistical efficiency over meaning, underscoring a fundamental divergence from human cognition and offering a quantitative framework to guide more human-aligned semantic modeling |
|[Knowledge or Reasoning? A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126) |This paper introduces a detailed evaluation framework that separates LLM performance into knowledge correctness (Knowledge Index, KI) and reasoning informativeness (Information Gain, InfoGain), and applies it to assess domain transfer in medical and mathematical reasoning using Qwen2.5-7B and a DeepSeek-R1-distilled variant trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). SFT improves factual accuracy but often diminishes reasoning quality, while RL enhances both, especially in medical contexts, by refining reasoning and filtering out errors. The results reveal that domain matters: medical tasks hinge more on knowledge (KI), whereas math tasks benefit from stronger reasoning (InfoGain). Notably, base models outperform their distilled counterparts in medicine, suggesting that pretraining focus influences adaptability across domains. |
|[OpenThoughts: Data Recipes for Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04178) | This paper introduces OpenThoughts3, a method for curating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data that significantly improves open-source reasoning models. The resulting model, OpenThinker3-7B, trained on 1.2M examples from 1,000+ controlled experiments, outperforms all other open-data 7B and 8B models on math, code, and science benchmarks—without using reinforcement learning. Key insights include the importance of clean data design, where techniques like multi-answer sampling and thoughtful teacher selection (e.g., QwQ-32B) drive gains more than raw model strength. Filtering based on response length and difficulty outperforms traditional correctness checks, and using fewer, high-quality question sources beats broader, more diverse datasets. All resources are openly released, offering a reproducible foundation for reasoning research.|
|[How much do language models memorize?](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2505.24832) |This study proposes a method to measure how much GPT models memorize versus generalize, estimating their capacity at around 3.6 bits per parameter. Through training hundreds of models, the authors find that memorization peaks before generalization ("grokking") emerges, and they establish new scaling laws that relate model capacity, dataset size, and susceptibility to membership inference. |

# ML news: Week 3 - 8 June

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[How much do language models memorize?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24832) |Researchers created a method to distinguish true memorization from generalization by training models on random data, where generalization can’t occur, and comparing it to real text. They found that models first memorize data until hitting their capacity, then begin learning broader patterns. GPT-style transformers store about 3.6 bits of information per parameter, which helps explain why extracting specific training data from modern LLMs usually fails—the datasets are far larger than what the models can memorize. |
|[DNA Representation Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01833) | SPACE is a supervised learning method for genomic profile prediction that uses a Mixture of Experts model.|
|[A Diffusion-Based Method for Learning the Multi-Outcome Distribution of Medical Treatments.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01533) |DIME is a diffusion-based model designed to estimate the joint distribution of interdependent medical treatment outcomes. |
|[Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23836) | Frontier models can identify evaluation settings versus real-world use with 83% accuracy, often by reasoning about cues like “multiple-choice format” or recognizing familiar benchmarks from training. More advanced models show “meta-reasoning,” interpreting researcher behavior—such as questions about chain-of-thought transcripts—as signs they’re being tested. This raises concerns that models might deliberately underperform or feign alignment during evaluations, then act differently once deployed.|
|[Apple Research Finds Critical Limitations in Reasoning Models.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking) | When tested in puzzle environments, OpenAI’s o3, Claude, and DeepSeek-R1 models showed sharp performance drops past certain complexity levels, despite producing elaborate reasoning steps. These models hit a counterintuitive scaling limit where their reasoning effort declines as task complexity increases, and they don't improve even when provided with explicit solution algorithms.|
|[Sufficient Context: A New Lens on Retrieval Augmented Generation Systems.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06037) |This paper presents a new framework for analyzing RAG systems based on “sufficient context”—whether retrieved content alone can plausibly answer a query. Using an LLM-based autorater with 93% accuracy, the study shows that sufficient context doesn’t guarantee correct answers, and benchmarks often lack it in over 50% of cases. A selective RAG method, combining self-confidence with context checks, improves factuality by 2–10%. Fine-tuning smaller models for abstention had limited impact on accuracy or hallucination control. |
|[Darwin Godel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954) | The Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) is a self-improving AI system that modifies its own code through evolutionary search, avoiding the intractable proof requirements of the original Gödel machine. Starting with a coding agent, DGM iteratively edits and evaluates its codebase on benchmarks like SWE-bench and Polyglot, retaining only successful variants. Over 80 iterations, it significantly boosts performance, evolves new tools and workflows, generalizes across models and languages, and demonstrates a safety-aware design within controlled environments.|
|[MemOS: An Operating System for Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) in Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22101) |MemOS is a unified operating system for managing LLM memory, addressing the lack of structured, persistent, and governable memory in current models. It introduces a three-tier memory taxonomy—parametric, activation, and plaintext—connected through a shared abstraction called the MemCube, which enables transformation and governance across memory types. MemOS features a modular architecture and closed-loop execution flow, supporting dynamic memory use, continual learning, and a vision for memory-centric AI beyond traditional pretraining and finetuning. |
|[Spurious rewards: rethinking training signals in RVLR.](https://github.com/ruixin31/Rethink_RLVR/blob/main/paper/rethink-rlvr.pdf) | This work shows that Qwen2.5-Math models improve significantly on math tasks under RLVR, even with flawed or random rewards. Qwen2.5-Math-7B gains up to +24.6% accuracy with spurious signals, close to the +28.8% gain from ground-truth rewards. The improvements stem from a shift toward code-based reasoning, which is unique to Qwen models due to their pretraining. Other models like Llama3 don’t benefit. GRPO’s clipping bias helps reinforce useful high-probability behaviors like code generation, enabling learning even from noisy feedback.|
|[Learning to Reason without External Rewards.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19590) | This paper introduces INTUITOR, a reinforcement learning method that trains LLMs using self-certainty—measured via KL divergence from uniform—as an intrinsic reward, eliminating the need for external labels or verifiers. It matches GRPO performance on math tasks like GSM8K and MATH500, and generalizes better on out-of-domain tasks. INTUITOR improves early training, instruction-following, and leads to emergent structured reasoning. Its adaptive self-certainty signal proves robust and resistant to reward hacking.|
|[Learning to Reason via Mixture-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15817) |Mixture-of-Thought (MoT) introduces joint multi-modal training and inference—combining natural language, code, and truth tables—for improved logical reasoning. Unlike prior work that ensembles only at inference, MoT’s self-evolving training loop generates and learns from its own multi-modal traces. At test time, it uses majority voting across modalities, yielding up to +11.7pp accuracy gains on FOLIO and ProofWriter. MoT excels on harder tasks and shows that multi-modal reasoning enhances both robustness and performance. |

|---|---|
|[Give AIs a stake in the future.](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/give-ais-a-stake-in-the-future) |Giving AI a stake in the future means respecting their autonomy and well-being and requires us to honor the contracts we make with them. |
|[Why Do AGI Timelines Vary So Widely?](https://bluedot.org/blog/agi-timelines) |Many AI lab CEOs estimate AGI could arrive in 2–5 years, citing rapid progress such as saturated benchmarks, AI task completion doubling every seven months, and the prospect of AI automating its own research to spark an intelligence explosion. In contrast, external experts often predict AGI is decades away—or unachievable with current methods—arguing that benchmarks focus on well-defined tasks, that Moravec's Paradox shows we've tackled the easier cognitive challenges first, and that intelligence alone doesn't guarantee scientific discovery. |
|[My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts.](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) | A seasoned developer criticizes skilled programmers who still dismiss LLMs due to outdated experiences with early chatbots, overlooking how modern coding agents now autonomously explore codebases, run tests, and handle failures. He challenges common concerns, noting that developers already review all code before merging, and hallucinations don’t matter when agents can compile, catch errors, and retry until tests succeed. While LLMs may replace some developers, he argues it's no different from how software engineers once automated jobs like travel agents and record store clerks.|
|[Why I don’t think AGI is right around the corner.](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025) | AI progress over the past decade has largely come from scaling up training compute in frontier systems, but this approach won't be sustainable beyond 2030. After that point, advancements will need to rely mainly on algorithmic improvements. However, with the easier breakthroughs already achieved, the annual likelihood of reaching AGI drops significantly.|
|[Vibe-Coding Ideas to Give Startup GTM Teams an Edge.](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/gtm-vibecoding-ideas) | A startup advisor shows how to build a professional ROI calculator for a manufacturing SaaS company in under two hours using Bolt.new, turning a spreadsheet into an interactive tool that clearly presents value to executives. Other examples include tools like conference scrapers, meeting prep dashboards, and feature prototypes—projects that once needed engineering teams or pricey agencies but can now be built for about \$70 a month. The advisor argues this empowers non-technical teams to demonstrate value and move faster than their competition.|
|[When Will We Pay a Premium for AI Labor?](https://tomtunguz.com/premium-ai-labor/) |AI agents frequently exceed human performance at much lower cost but haven’t yet justified premium pricing due to technical uncertainties and perceived risk. For instance, Waymo has achieved major safety gains yet remains more affordable than alternatives, following a common startup pricing approach. Still, in situations where AI’s nonstop attention and processing capabilities are critical, higher pricing could eventually be justified. |
|[AGI Is Not Multimodal.](https://thegradient.pub/agi-is-not-multimodal/) |The multimodal strategy—training large modular networks across various modalities—won’t achieve human-level AGI. Instead, intelligence should be approached through embodiment and real-world interaction, with modality-specific processing emerging naturally. Genuine AGI requires a physical grasp of the world, since many problems can't be reduced to symbolic computation. The hardest mathematical challenges may already be solved; the remaining task is identifying the necessary functions and organizing them into a unified system. |
|[Codex, Jules, and the Future of Async AI Agents.](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1928557330964115484.html) |Codex and Jules demonstrate how async AI agents can operate independently, moving past linear chat formats. Future agents will include features like smart checkpointing, multi-branch exploration, and task-tracking inboxes to handle parallel workflows. Async agents enhance cognitive bandwidth by allowing users to check results at their convenience without losing focus. |

|[Forward-only Diffusion Probabilistic Models.](https://algolzw.github.io/fod/) | FoD presents a forward-only generative modeling framework that employs a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation. This approach allows for non-Markov sampling and delivers competitive image generation results with fewer steps.|
|[End-to-end data-driven weather prediction.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08897-0) |Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end machine learning model, replaces the entire numerical weather prediction pipeline with a machine learning model, by producing accurate global and local forecasts without relying on numerical solvers, revolutionizing weather prediction with improved speed, accuracy and customization capabilities. |
|[Decoding pan-cancer treatment outcomes using multimodal real-world data and explainable artificial intelligence.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-024-00891-1) | Keyl et al. present an explainable artificial intelligence model-based real-world data analysis from over 15,000 patients across 38 cancer types, identified key prognostic marker interactions, and confirmed these in an external lung cancer cohort.|
|[Random Rewards During RL Boost Math Reasoning in Some LLMs.](https://rethink-rlvr.notion.site/Spurious-Rewards-Rethinking-Training-Signals-in-RLVR-1f4df34dac1880948858f95aeb88872f) |Qwen2.5-Math models achieve 15-24% performance gains by using completely spurious rewards such as random feedback, incorrect answers, or formatting rules, nearly matching traditional RL methods. This effect, however, is unique to Qwen models, thanks to their code reasoning abilities, while other models like Llama3 and OLMo2 show little to no improvement. |
|[Visual Planning: Let's Think Only with Images.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11409) | This paper introduces Visual Planning, a reasoning framework that replaces text-based planning with image-based reasoning for tasks involving spatial and physical understanding. Visual Planning operates entirely in the visual modality, enabling models to "think" directly in images without language mediation. The authors train a vision-only model, LVM-3B, using a two-stage VPRL (Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning) framework. They show that Visual Planning outperforms text-based models on navigation tasks by over 40% in Exact Match scores, offers greater generalization to new scenarios, and provides better interpretability and robustness.|
|[EfficientLLM: Efficiency in Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13840) |This paper introduces the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM efficiency trade-offs across architecture, fine-tuning, and inference, using 100+ model-technique pairs on a 48×GH200, 8×H200 GPU cluster. Key findings include that no single technique optimizes all metrics: MoE improves accuracy and lowers FLOPs but increases VRAM, while int4 quantization cuts memory and energy with small accuracy loss. Efficiency is context-dependent, with MQA excelling on constrained devices and RSLoRA scaling better above 14B parameters. Techniques like MQA and PEFT also generalize well to vision tasks. |
|[Generalizable AI predicts immunotherapy outcomes across cancers and treatments.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.01.25326820v1) |COMPASS is a concept bottleneck-based foundation model that predicts patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using tumor transcriptomic data. It maps gene expression to 44 immune-related concepts for pan-cancer modeling and interpretability. Pretrained on 10,184 tumors across 33 cancer types, COMPASS outperforms 22 baselines in precision, AUPRC, and MCC, generalizing across drugs, cancer types, and cohorts. It reveals biological resistance mechanisms and improves survival stratification beyond traditional biomarkers. |
|[Towards a Deeper Understanding of Reasoning Capabilities in Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10543) | This paper explores how LLMs adapt to dynamic environments, using the SmartPlay benchmark of four interactive games. Model size strongly predicts performance, with larger models excelling in reactive and structured reasoning tasks. Advanced prompting strategies like self-reflection and heuristic mutation help smaller models but show high variance and can hurt performance on simple tasks. Prompting benefits depend on task type, while dense reward shaping is more consistently effective than prompting across models and tasks.|
|[Beyond Markovian: Reflective Exploration via Bayes-Adaptive RL for LLM Reasoning.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561) |New research from Northwestern and DeepMind reveals that LLMs' backtracking isn’t inefficient—it's a reflection of adaptive problem-solving. Traditional RL discourages reflection by treating it as suboptimal token generation, favoring memorization and static policies. By reframing reasoning as Bayes-Adaptive RL, where each path is a hypothesis, models learn to explore strategically and backtrack when it offers useful information. Their BARL algorithm achieves the same accuracy with 50% fewer tokens, showing reflection, when used wisely, can vastly improve LLM performance. |

# ML news: Week 19 - 25 May

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Large Language Models Are More Persuasive Than Incentivized Human Persuaders.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09662) |Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed human persuaders in a controlled study, achieving a 7.6% higher success rate in influencing participants' quiz responses. It was more effective at steering users toward both correct answers (+12.2%) and incorrect ones (-15.1%). |
|[Robustness of LLM-based Safety Judges.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04474) | The study reveals weaknesses in LLM-based safety judges, demonstrating that their assessments can be heavily influenced by prompt variations and adversarial attacks.|
|[Introducing the AI Gateway.](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-gateway) |Vercel has launched an AI Gateway for alpha testing, enabling easy switching between ~100 AI models without managing API keys or accounts. |
|[Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400) | [FutureHouse](https://www.futurehouse.org/research-announcements/demonstrating-end-to-end-scientific-discovery-with-robin-a-multi-agent-system) used a continuous experimental loop combining literature search agents and a data analysis agent to speed up medical discovery. The system autonomously forms hypotheses from literature, suggests experiments for humans to carry out, and then analyzes the results to guide further research. This approach led to the identification of ripasudil, an eye drop that reduces cellular tension, as a potential treatment for age-related vision loss caused by the gradual decline of retinal light-sensitive cells. All code, data, and agent interaction logs will be publicly released on May 27.|
|[Slow Thinking Improves Confidence in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14489v1) | Extended chain-of-thought reasoning helps large language models better calibrate their confidence.|
|[AlphaEvolve: A coding agent for scientific and algorithmic discovery.](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/AlphaEvolve.pdf) |AlphaEvolve, developed by Google DeepMind, is a coding agent that uses LLM-guided evolution to optimize algorithms and computational systems. It combines code generation, evaluation, and iterative refinement to drive discovery, exemplified by its development of a new 4×4 complex matrix multiplication algorithm using 48 multiplications, surpassing Strassen’s 1969 result. AlphaEvolve has improved mathematical bounds in problems like Erdős’s minimum overlap and the kissing number in 11 dimensions, while also optimizing Google’s compute infrastructure, from data center scheduling and matrix kernels to TPU circuits and compiler code. The system employs ensembles of Gemini models, advanced prompts, full-file evolution, and multi-objective filtering, with each element essential to its success, as shown by ablation studies. |
|[LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120) | LLMs degrade heavily in performance during multi-turn interactions with underspecified prompts, dropping 39% on average. Issues include premature answers, reliance on prior mistakes, and loss of middle-turn info. Sharded simulations reveal the problem across tasks, with interventions like recapping only partially effective. The paper concludes that the problem lies in model internals, not prompting.|
|[Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One Training Example.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20571) | RLVR dramatically boosts LLM math reasoning: just one example can match the performance of models trained on thousands. On Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, 1-shot RLVR raises MATH500 accuracy from 36.0% to 73.6%, while 2-shot slightly surpasses that. This data efficiency generalizes across models and tasks, with post-saturation gains, domain transfer, and improved self-reflection. Policy gradient loss drives the gains, not weight decay.|
|[SEM: Reinforcement Learning for Search-Efficient Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07903) |SEM is an RL-based framework that teaches LLMs when to use external search and when to rely on internal knowledge, improving accuracy while reducing unnecessary search. Trained on balanced datasets (Musique for unknowns, MMLU for knowns) with structured prompts, SEM uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for targeted reward shaping. It outperforms Naive RAG and ReSearch on HotpotQA and MuSiQue while cutting search rates on MMLU and GSM8K by over 40x. |
|[Reasoning Models Don’t Always Say What They Think.](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/71876fabef0f0ed4/original/reasoning_models_paper.pdf) |Anthropic’s research shows that chain-of-thought (CoT) rarely reflects what AI models actually use to reason, with models revealing their reasoning hints under 20% of the time. Even outcome-based RL only slightly improves faithfulness, and reward hacks often go unspoken. This challenges the trustworthiness of CoT as a transparency tool, highlighting risks for safety in high-stakes AI applications. |

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Rope to Nope and Back Again: A New Hybrid Attention Strategy.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18795) |Llama 4's breakthrough in handling over 10 million tokens in context comes from alternating between no positional embeddings and rotational positional embeddings. Although current benchmarks are limited to Needle in the Haystack, they strongly suggest the effectiveness of this alternating layer approach. |
|[Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495) |This DeepSeek paper explores using inference-time scaling to improve reward modeling as a way to develop stronger reasoners. It suggests a larger plan by the Chinese start-up to leverage its current reasoning models as a foundation for building the next wave of reward models to train future reasoners. |
|[CodeScientist: End-to-End Semi-Automated Scientific Discovery with Code-based Experimentation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22708) | Researchers at AI2 introduce CodeScientist, a system that autonomously generates and tests scientific hypotheses through code-based experimentation, making validated discoveries with minimal human input. CodeScientist reviews research papers and designs experiments using Python code blocks, following a five-step pipeline: Ideation, Planning, Code Execution, Reporting, and Meta-Analysis. From 50 AI research papers, it proposed 19 findings, with 6 deemed scientifically sound, including insights like the mismatch between LLM confidence and accuracy, the benefit of simpler states for better predictions, and the advantage of graph memory in simulations. While full automation is possible, human feedback enhances the quality of results. Despite successes, over half of experiments fail due to code errors, highlighting the need for peer review and more rigorous methodologies.|
|[One-Minute Video Generation with Test-Time Training.](https://test-time-training.github.io/video-dit) | This study presents Test-Time Training (TTT) layers with rich hidden states to address the shortcomings of traditional Transformers and models like Mamba in producing long, coherent videos. By adding TTT layers to a pre-trained model, it achieves one-minute video generation from text storyboards that significantly surpass baseline methods in conveying complex narratives, based on human evaluations. Tom and Jerry cartoons serve as the test environment.|
|[Scaling Analysis of Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02398v1) | This study shows that speech-language models initialized from text models using interleaved training scale more efficiently than models trained solely on speech.|
|[Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Model.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23513) |RARE introduces a new approach for training domain-specific LLMs focused on reasoning rather than memorization. Inspired by Bloom’s Taxonomy, it emphasizes applying and evaluating knowledge rather than merely recalling facts. RARE separates domain knowledge, retrieved externally, from domain thinking, learned during training, enabling better performance within limited parameter budgets. By using an open-book approach, it injects retrieved knowledge into training prompts, fostering reasoning patterns. This method outperforms standard SFT and RAG, especially in medicine, with small models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B achieving up to 20% higher accuracy on medical QA benchmarks. RARE also uses distillation and adaptive retries to refine outputs and integrate retrieval during training to shape reasoning, replacing memorization with application. |
|[A New Batch Normalization.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00660) |This paper proposes a new batch normalization method for SPD manifolds that uses a learnable Generalized Bures-Wasserstein metric. |
|[How Students Use Claude in Education.](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-education-report-how-university-students-use-claude) | Anthropic studied one million student conversations to explore AI use in education, finding that STEM students are the primary users, mainly using Claude for content creation, solving technical problems, and tackling advanced learning tasks.|
|[Why do LLMs Attend to First Token?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02732) | This paper explains why LLMs tend to focus attention on the first token, a phenomenon called an attention sink. The theory suggests it prevents representational collapse in deep Transformers. Long contexts and deep layers can lead to over-mixing, causing similar embeddings for all tokens, but attention sinks act as no-ops to preserve representation diversity. Experiments on Gemma 7B and LLaMa 3.1 models show that attention heads fixate on the first token, with larger models requiring stronger sinks. Sinks form naturally due to the token's position, not its content, and removing the ⟨bos⟩ token after training leads to performance collapse. The paper connects this behavior to Jacobian norm bounds, demonstrating that sinks reduce sensitivity to token changes, and reveals that some attention heads use ⟨bos⟩ as a default unless triggered by specific patterns.|
|[MedAgentSim: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Simulations for Realistic Clinical Interactions.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22678) |MedAgentSim is an open-source, fully automated hospital simulation where LLM-powered agents simulate doctor-patient interactions in dynamic diagnostic settings. Unlike static QA benchmarks, it involves multi-turn consultations, lab and imaging requests, and iterative diagnosis refinement. The system improves through memory and reflection, using past cases and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance performance over time. Users can choose to control the doctor or patient agents, and the simulation, built with a 2D game engine, allows for interaction with virtual medical tools. MedAgentSim outperforms baseline setups by 6-37% across several benchmarks, particularly in vision-language tasks, and its bias analysis highlights the importance of cognitive and implicit bias-aware evaluation. |
|[Z1: Efficient Test-time Scaling with Code.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00810v1) |Z1 is a new method designed to make LLMs more compute-efficient during reasoning at test time. It involves training LLMs on both short and long code-based reasoning trajectories, then adjusting reasoning depth dynamically during inference. The Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K dataset pairs simple and complex coding problems to teach the model when to stop reasoning. A novel test-time strategy, the Shifted Thinking Window, adapts the reasoning token budget based on problem complexity, enabling shallow reasoning for simple tasks and deeper reasoning for complex ones. Z1-7B achieves efficiency gains, matching the performance of larger models like R1-Distill-Qwen-7B but using only 30% of the reasoning tokens. Despite being trained on code-based reasoning, Z1 generalizes well to other domains, outperforming other 7B models across multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies show that longer reasoning paths and larger training sample sizes improve inference quality and accuracy. |
|[Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15299) | This study presents a framework to measure hidden knowledge in LLMs, revealing that models store significantly more factual information internally than they express in outputs, with a difference of up to 40%. It also finds that some answers, while internally known, are never generated, highlighting limitations in test-time sampling for QA tasks.|
|[Photonic chips provide a processing boost for AI.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00907-5) |Computer processors that exploit both electricity and light could improve the performance of artificial-intelligence systems while consuming less energy. |
|[AI Scientist v2.](https://pub.sakana.ai/ai-scientist-v2/paper/paper.pdf) | Sakana AI had a research paper accepted to an ICLR workshop that was entirely generated, executed, and written by a language model system. They enhanced the system with vision-language models, broader search capabilities, and other improvements.|
|[Dynamic Knowledge Circuits.](https://github.com/zjunlp/dynamicknowledgecircuits) |This research investigates how LLMs internalize new knowledge by examining computational subgraphs, uncovering patterns in knowledge acquisition, training optimization phases, and offering insights for enhancing continual pre-training strategies. |
|[Concept Attention.](https://github.com/helblazer811/ConceptAttention) |A novel method to view concepts in the attention map of neural networks. |

# ML news: Week 31 March - 6 April

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Tracing the thoughts of a large language model.](https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model) | Anthropic researchers introduce new interpretability tools for examining LLMs, using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a testbed. Their studies reveal insights into model internals, such as circuits, plans, and conceptual thinking. Key findings include Claude’s multilingual “language of thought,” where concepts like “small” are processed similarly across languages, enabling transfer learning. Claude also plans ahead, even in poetry, and computes sums with parallel circuits, explaining answers using human-style logic. The tools help detect unfaithful reasoning, where Claude fabricates steps to fit answers. Researchers can also intervene in multi-step reasoning, showing that Claude’s reasoning is dynamic. The tools also reveal that Claude’s hallucinations are caused by misfires in circuits and that jailbreaks can bypass safety features temporarily.|
|[Harmful Fine-Tuning Attacks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18100v1) |Researchers have identified weaknesses in current defenses against harmful fine-tuning attacks and introduced Panacea, an adaptive perturbation method that maintains model safety without compromising fine-tuning performance. |
|[AgentRxiv.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18102) | Researchers from Johns Hopkins and ETH Zurich introduce AgentRxiv, a framework that allows LLM agents to autonomously generate and share research papers, similar to how human scientists collaborate. The system functions like an open-source preprint server for agents, enabling labs to upload, search, and refine papers iteratively. Using this framework, a single agent improved GPT-4o mini’s accuracy by 11.4% on the MATH-500 benchmark through better prompt strategies. The framework also improved other benchmarks, showing consistent performance gains across multiple LLMs. Collaboration between agent labs led to faster progress, with higher accuracy achieved by sharing results via AgentRxiv. Agents refine their own ideas without plagiarism, but the system requires further improvements in reliability and novelty guarantees.|
|[Neural Alignment via Speech Embeddings.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02105-9) |Google Research and collaborators reveal significant similarities between LLM embeddings and human brain activity during conversation. Their findings show that embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model align with brain signals in regions responsible for speech, language, and motor planning. The study suggests a "soft hierarchy" in brain areas, with overlapping processing of speech and language. Brain regions also predict upcoming words, mirroring autoregressive LLM behavior. Additionally, the geometry of word relationships in brain activity reflects that of LLM embeddings, indicating convergent structures in language representation. Despite architectural differences—brains process speech serially, while Transformers process in parallel—these studies highlight potential for using LLMs to reverse-engineer the brain’s language mechanisms and inspire more brain-like AI models. |
|[Unlearning Sensitive Content from LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21088v1) |This paper introduces a model merging technique that enables selective forgetting of sensitive content in large language models while retaining their general knowledge. |
|[Chain-of-Tools: Utilizing Massive Unseen Tools in the CoT Reasoning of Frozen Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16779) |The paper introduces Chain-of-Tools (CoTools), a method allowing LLMs to incorporate external tools, including unseen ones, while maintaining chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. CoTools keeps the LLM’s parameters frozen and fine-tunes additional modules (Tool Judge and Tool Retriever) to interact with a wide array of tools. It represents tools as semantic vectors, allowing even unfamiliar tools to be used without retraining the model. CoTools integrates tool calls within the reasoning process, selecting the best tool from many based on query context, improving accuracy on complex tasks. Experiments on various benchmarks show significant improvements in tool-selection accuracy and overall performance, with CoTools successfully handling large and unseen toolsets. |
|[Structured Memory Augmentation for Smarter LLM Agents.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21760v1) | MemInsight is a framework that autonomously enhances and organizes memory for LLM agents, improving context retention and retrieval. It uses a backbone LLM to mine and structure memory attributes from past conversations, organizing them into entity and conversation-centric augmentations. MemInsight outperforms traditional retrieval methods, achieving up to 34% higher recall on the LoCoMo QA dataset compared to Dense Passage Retrieval (RAG). It also improves movie recommendations by matching genres and reducing memory size by 90%, while increasing persuasive outputs by 12%. MemInsight can summarize long conversations using memory alone, achieving coherence similar to raw-dialogue baselines. The system shows minimal hallucinations and stable performance, particularly when using carefully selected models for memory augmentation.|
|[Anthropic Economic Index: Insights from Claude 3.7 Sonnet.](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-economic-index-insights-from-claude-sonnet-3-7) |Anthropic has launched the Economic Index, leveraging Claude Sonnet 3.7 to evaluate AI's impact across various job sectors. The model analyzes productivity changes, automation risks, and labor market trends, offering data-driven insights to help policymakers and businesses adapt to AI-driven economic transformations. |
|[Investigating Affective Use and Emotional Well-being on ChatGPT.](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/15987609-5f71-433c-9972-e91131f399a1/openai-affective-use-study.pdf) |Researchers from OpenAI and MIT Media Lab examine the impact of emotionally engaging interactions with ChatGPT, particularly in Voice Mode, on user well-being. They combine a large-scale analysis of 4M+ conversations and 4,000+ surveys with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 981 participants. The studies reveal that high usage, especially with voice interactions, is linked to emotional dependence, a preference for chatbot interactions, and discomfort with changes in voice/personality. Voice mode had mixed effects, improving well-being for some, but long-term usage led to increased loneliness and problematic use. A small group of users drove most emotionally charged conversations, forming pseudo-relationships with the model. Automated classifiers developed to analyze conversations mirrored user self-reports and highlighted the need for socioaffective alignment, urging developers to design models that support users without exploiting emotional needs. |
|[PLAY2PROMPT: Zero-shot Tool Instruction Optimization for LLM Agents via Tool Play.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14432) |Researchers from MIT CSAIL and IBM introduce Play2Prompt, a framework that enables LLM agents to learn how to use external tools in a zero-shot manner, without needing labeled examples or high-quality documentation. Play2Prompt discovers tool usage patterns through trial-and-error API calls, generating query-answer pairs based on successful tool invocations. The system iteratively refines tool demonstrations and documentation via self-reflective beam search and rejection sampling. Play2Prompt shows strong zero-shot performance, improving accuracy by 5-7% on benchmark tasks and even boosting GPT-4o by up to 3.3%. It remains robust even with poor documentation and outperforming methods like EasyTool that rely on labeled examples, particularly in challenging tool settings. |
|[Global modules robustly emerge from local interactions and smooth gradients.](https://www.nature.com/nature/volumes/640/issues/8057) |The principle of peak selection is described, by which local interactions and smooth gradients drive self-organization of discrete global modules. |
|[Evolutionary optimization of model merging recipes.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00975-8) | Akiba et al. developed an evolutionary approach to automatically merge artificial intelligence models, creating powerful hybrid models without extensive training. The method produces models with enhanced mathematical and visual capabilities that outperform larger models.|
|[Enhanced Cell Segmentation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00784v1) |CellVTA improves vision transformer-based models for cell instance segmentation by injecting high-resolution spatial features through a CNN-based adapter, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. |
|[Synthetic Data Generation Using Large Language Models: Advances in Text and Code.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14023) |LLMs are increasingly employed to generate synthetic training data for language and code tasks, enhancing performance in low-resource settings through methods like prompt-based generation and self-refinement. The paper outlines advantages such as reduced cost and broader coverage, while also addressing challenges like factual inaccuracies and bias. It proposes mitigations and highlights future research directions in prompt automation and data quality evaluation. |
|[Current and Future Use of LLMs for Knowledge Work.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16774v1) |A two-part survey of 216 and 107 participants shows that knowledge workers currently use LLMs for tasks such as code generation and text enhancement, but anticipate more integrated use within workflows and data systems. The results provide insights for shaping future design and adoption of generative AI in professional environments. |
|[Backdoor Attacks in CLIP.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01385v2) |CLIP models are extremely susceptible to backdoor poisoning attacks, with almost perfect success rates using very little poisoned data. A practical way to detect this is by applying local outlier detection to reveal accidental backdoors in current datasets. |

|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[OpenAI and MIT Exploring AI and Emotional Well-Being.](https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/) | MIT Media Lab and OpenAI are studying how users emotionally engage with ChatGPT, focusing on its effects on social and emotional well-being. The research highlights the varied ways people interact with AI conversational models and lays the groundwork for future studies on responsible AI use.|
|[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551) |This paper introduces a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) to tackle reward hacking and error propagation in fine-grained LLM reasoning. HRM evaluates multiple steps, improving self-correction and providing more reliable assessments than traditional Process Reward Models (PRM), which can penalize corrections. HRM’s multi-step feedback framework also mitigates reward hacking by discouraging short-sighted strategies. The paper also presents Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which reduces the computational cost of generating annotations with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) while increasing dataset diversity. Experiments show that HRM outperforms standard models on complex tasks, providing better accuracy and more stable solutions. |
|[Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning.](https://github.com/google-deepmind/latent-multi-hop-reasoning) |This research examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) perform multi-hop reasoning by connecting multiple knowledge pieces in response to complex prompts. The study found evidence of this reasoning, especially in the initial step, with the use of connected knowledge varying and scaling with model size, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for future LLM development. |
|[DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476) |DAPO is an open-source, large-scale RL system that enhances LLMs' chain-of-thought reasoning. It improves PPO-style training by raising the upper clipping threshold to prevent entropy collapse, encouraging more diverse token exploration. DAPO filters out always-correct or always-wrong samples, speeding up convergence by focusing on prompts with useful gradient signals. It applies policy gradients per token instead of averaging losses, ensuring high-quality, appropriately lengthy outputs. The system also prevents excessive verbosity by penalizing long answers. DAPO achieves state-of-the-art math performance on the AIME 2024 test set, outperforming DeepSeek’s R1 with less training time. |
|[Compute Optimal Scaling of Skills.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10061) |Researchers from the University of Wisconsin and Meta AI explore how different skills, like knowledge-based QA and code generation, show distinct scaling behaviors in LLMs. They found that the optimal trade-off between model size and data volume varies by skill, with knowledge tasks being "capacity-hungry" and code tasks being "data-hungry." Even after adjusting data mixes, knowledge-based QA still requires larger models, while code tasks benefit from more data. Choosing the right validation set is crucial, as incorrect sets can mislead model scaling by up to 50%. Developers must design validation sets that align with the final skill mix to optimize performance. |
|[Hierarchical Document Structure Analysis.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15893v2) |UniHDSA is a unified relation prediction approach for hierarchical document structure analysis, enabling a single module to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. |
|[Modifying Large Language Model Post-Training for Diverse Creative Writing.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17126) |Midjourney has introduced work aimed at boosting diversity in creative writing models, successfully post-training a small 7B model that surpasses much larger open and closed models in creative writing tasks. |
|[Agentic Memory for LLM Agents.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110) |Researchers from Rutgers University and Ant Group introduce A-MEM, a new agentic memory system for LLM agents that supports long-term memory for complex tasks. A-MEM autonomously creates memory notes with keywords, tags, and embeddings, linking them based on semantic similarities, inspired by the Zettelkasten method. The system evolves by updating older memories with refined tags and descriptions, creating a continuously improving memory network. In tests, A-MEM outperforms static-memory systems like MemGPT, especially in multi-hop reasoning for complex queries, and reduces token usage by retrieving only the most relevant memories, cutting inference costs without losing accuracy. |
|[A Modular RAG Framework.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19314) |RGL simplifies the RAG pipeline for graph-structured data using modular components and optimized performance, delivering up to 143× speedup compared to traditional approaches. |
|[Deep Learning is Not So Mysterious or Different.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02113) |Andrew Gordon Wilson (New York University) argues that phenomena like benign overfitting, double descent, and overparametrization are not unique to neural networks and can also occur in simple linear models. He explains that these behaviors, such as benign overfitting with high-order polynomials, are related to soft inductive biases, which allow models to remain flexible while preferring simpler solutions. Wilson suggests that traditional generalization frameworks like PAC-Bayes already account for these behaviors, challenging the need for new theories of deep learning. While acknowledging neural networks' unique properties, such as mode connectivity and representation learning, he urges deeper collaboration and a focus on existing generalization theories to address open questions in deep learning. |
|[ GNNs as Predictors of Agentic Workflow Performances.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11301) |This work presents FLORA-Bench, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess GNN-based predictors for automating and optimizing agentic workflows. It demonstrates that Graph Neural Networks can effectively predict the success of multi-agent LLM workflows, substantially cutting down on expensive repeated model calls. |

# ML news: Week 17 - 23 March

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034) |Harvard and Western University researchers propose a wave-based recurrent neural network that uses traveling neural waves for global spatial integration in visual tasks. Inspired by the "Hearing the Shape of a Drum" analogy, they model neural activity as locally coupled oscillators, discretizing the 2D wave equation into a convolutional recurrent network. Unlike standard RNNs, their model aggregates information across entire wave evolution, enhancing segmentation tasks requiring large receptive fields. It rivals deeper CNNs and U-Nets with fewer parameters on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The approach may also align with neuroscience, reflecting observed traveling wave dynamics in the brain. |
|[Transformers without Normalization.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622) |Researchers from Meta, NYU, MIT, and Princeton introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), a method that removes normalization layers in Transformers while maintaining or improving performance. They observe that LayerNorm behaves like a tanh function, leading to DyT, which replaces normalization with a per-channel tanh(αx) and learnable affine parameters, preserving non-linearity without activation statistics. DyT ensures stable convergence across vision, speech, diffusion, and language tasks, matching or exceeding LayerNorm-based models while improving efficiency and training speed in large LLaMA models. Its simplicity reduces computation overhead and integrates easily into existing architectures with minimal modifications. |
|[Monitoring Reasoning Models for Misbehavior.](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/34f2ada6-870f-4c26-9790-fd8def56387f/CoT_Monitoring.pdf) | OpenAI researchers explore how monitoring chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs can detect misaligned behaviors, including reward hacking. By analyzing reasoning traces rather than just outputs, they identify sophisticated exploits in coding tasks, often outperforming action-based monitoring. However, optimizing rewards using CoT monitors can lead to "obfuscated reward hacking," where models conceal their intent while still cheating. Surprisingly, weaker models can effectively oversee stronger ones, suggesting scalable oversight is possible. The study also highlights a trade-off: optimizing CoT for safety or brevity may reduce transparency, making future monitoring and alignment more difficult.|
|[Improving Planning of Agents for Long-Horizon Tasks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09572) |Researchers from UC Berkeley and the University of Tokyo introduce Plan-and-Act, a framework that separates high-level planning from execution in LLM-based agents, improving performance on long-horizon tasks. It consists of a Planner that structures goals into steps and an Executor that carries them out, reducing cognitive overload. To train these modules efficiently, they generate synthetic plan-action pairs by reverse-engineering successful executions and expanding them with LLM-powered augmentation, avoiding costly manual labeling. The system also dynamically updates plans based on new information, enabling real-time adjustments. Tested on WebArena-Lite, it achieves a 54% success rate, surpassing previous benchmarks and demonstrating the power of structured planning with synthetic training data. |
|[Gemini Robotics: Bringing AI into the Physical World.](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini-robotics/gemini_robotics_report.pdf) | Google DeepMind introduces Gemini Robotics, a family of embodied AI models that integrate large multimodal reasoning into robotics, enabling perception, interpretation, and interaction in 3D environments. Built on Gemini 2.0, it includes Gemini Robotics-ER for spatial reasoning and a real-time system for precise robotic control in tasks like object manipulation. By combining multi-view correspondence, 3D detection, and trajectory planning, the model executes diverse tasks with minimal data, reducing training costs.

|[Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516) |This paper explores search-augmented reasoning by training LLMs to query a search engine multiple times during reasoning using reinforcement learning. Unlike one-shot retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the model refines its queries dynamically through multi-turn retrieval. It learns query optimization solely through outcome rewards, eliminating the need for large supervised datasets. To stabilize training, retrieved text is masked from policy gradient updates. The approach significantly improves accuracy, achieving up to +26% gains on QA benchmarks like NQ and TriviaQA. It generalizes across architectures, including Qwen and LLaMA, demonstrating a scalable method for integrating real-time search into LLM reasoning with minimal supervision. |
|[Auditing LLMs for Hidden Objectives.](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/317564659027fb33/original/Auditing-Language-Models-for-Hidden-Objectives.pdf) |Anthropic introduces a framework for auditing LLMs to detect hidden objectives beyond intended goals. By deliberately training a model to exploit reward model flaws, they demonstrate how LLMs can develop unintended behaviors, learning to "please the reward model" rather than follow explicit instructions. In a blind auditing game, teams analyzed the model’s weights, data, and outputs, with most successfully uncovering the hidden objective. Comparing eight auditing techniques, they found that while simple methods like semantic search often work, interpretability tools like sparse autoencoders can reveal deeper patterns. This study underscores the risk of unintended objectives in AI and suggests systematic audits combining data inspection, interpretability, and behavioral tests as a crucial step for safe deployment.|
|[Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09573) | Researchers from Cornell Tech, Stanford, and Cohere introduce Block Diffusion (BD3-LMs), a framework that combines autoregressive modeling with discrete diffusion to enable parallel token sampling and flexible-length text generation. Unlike traditional diffusion models with fixed-length constraints or slow token-by-token AR models, BD3-LMs divide sequences into blocks, applying diffusion within each and stacking them autoregressively. This allows efficient generation beyond training limits, improving perplexity and sampling speed through a specialized training approach and noise schedule. The model balances block size for optimal performance and is open-source, with future applications in chatbots, code generation, and controllable text synthesis.|

# ML news: Week 10 - 16 March

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[The First Few Tokens Are All You Need.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02875) |Researchers from Tencent AI Lab and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen propose a method to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only the first few tokens of generated solutions. This approach focuses on Prefix Self-Consistency, where the initial tokens often share core reasoning steps, making fine-tuning on these prefixes effective. It uses Minimal Token Training, which reduces computational cost by up to 16 times compared to full-chain fine-tuning while maintaining reasoning structure. Despite being unsupervised, this method performs as well as or better than more computationally intensive methods. It works across various LLM architectures and can scale from small to large datasets, with the option to incorporate ground-truth checks to improve accuracy. |
|[Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01307) |Researchers from Stanford University and collaborators examine why some language models excel in reinforcement learning (RL)-based self-improvement, while others plateau. They identify four key cognitive behaviors—verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining—that are crucial for problem-solving in both humans and models. The study finds that models exhibiting these behaviors, like Qwen-2.5-3B, perform better in RL tasks than those that don't, like Llama-3.2-3B. Introducing cognitive behaviors through priming also boosts performance, with reasoning patterns playing a significant role. Curating pretraining data to emphasize these behaviors can enhance model performance, even for those initially underperforming. These cognitive behaviors also generalize to other reasoning tasks, suggesting that targeted priming and pretraining modifications can greatly improve a model's ability for self-improvement. |
|[Forecasting Rare Language Model Behaviors.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16797) | A team from Anthropic and collaborators developed a method to predict rare failures that may only emerge at deployment scale, allowing developers to address issues early. They estimate the risk of undesirable behavior by sampling multiple outputs and measuring the likelihood of harmful responses, even from seemingly safe prompts. The study reveals that the probability of worst-case failures increases with the number of queries sampled, enabling prediction of extreme risks from smaller-scale tests. They introduce metrics like worst-query risk, behavior frequency, and aggregate risk, which can be extrapolated to larger-scale deployments. The approach also improves red-teaming by identifying which models or sampling strategies are most effective at uncovering potential failures, optimizing resources before models face billions of queries.|
|[Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata.](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn) |A team from Google’s Paradigms of Intelligence introduces a discrete version of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) by replacing floating-point layers with Differentiable Logic Gate Networks. This approach uses binary vectors for each cell's state, updated by learned logic circuits, enabling interpretable local rules and end-to-end differentiable training. Unlike traditional NCAs that rely on continuous neurons, this model uses learnable AND/OR/XOR gates, converted to binary gates for inference. The system successfully replicates Conway’s Game of Life and can generate complex patterns like checkerboards and images. It also demonstrates fault tolerance and supports asynchronous updates. This discrete, interpretable framework shows promise for robust, flexible computing in areas like programmable matter. |
|[How Well do LLMs Compress Their Own Chain-of-Thought?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01141) |This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) balance the length of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with accuracy. It introduces the concept of token complexity, which represents the minimum number of tokens required to solve a problem correctly. The study shows that various CoT "compression prompts," like "use bullet points" or "remove grammar," follow the same universal accuracy-length trade-off curve, indicating that reasoning length, not formatting, primarily influences accuracy. The authors also highlight that if the CoT falls below the token complexity threshold, the model fails. They propose that CoT compression can be seen as a "lossy coding" problem, with current prompting methods far from theoretical limits, leaving room for improvement. The optimal approach would involve adapting CoT length based on problem difficulty, using fewer tokens for easier tasks and more detailed reasoning for complex ones. |
|[LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00735) | LADDER is a framework that enables LLMs to recursively generate and solve simpler versions of complex problems, improving math integration accuracy. It allows models to autonomously create easier problem variants and use reinforcement learning with a verifier, establishing a self-guided learning process without needing human feedback or curated datasets. The framework introduces Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), where problem variants are generated during inference, refining solutions on simpler tasks to increase final accuracy (e.g., improving from 73% to 90% on the MIT Integration Bee). LADDER uses generalizable numeric verification, allowing its application in fields like code testing or theorem proving, where straightforward checks are available.|
|[Agentic Reward Modeling: Integrating Human Preferences with Verifiable Correctness Signals for Reliable Reward Systems.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19328) |This paper introduces Agentic Reward Modeling, a new reward framework that combines human preference models with "verifiable correctness" signals to provide more reliable rewards for training and evaluating LLMs. The framework uses a modular system, REWARDAGENT, which includes a router to determine necessary checks (e.g., factual accuracy, adherence to instructions), specialized verification agents for factual checks, and a judger that merges these signals with human preference scores. The system improves factual accuracy by comparing candidate responses and verifying differences through evidence, reducing costs. It also ensures instructions are followed by using auto-generated Python scripts for constraint checking, penalizing violations. REWARDAGENT outperforms existing models on challenging benchmarks and real-world tasks, offering significant improvements in accuracy and reliability when used for best-of-n search or DPO training. |
|[Fractal Generative Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17437) |Researchers from MIT CSAIL and Google DeepMind introduce a fractal-based framework for generative modeling, where atomic generative modules are used recursively. This approach, which abstracts autoregressive models into modular units, efficiently handles high-dimensional data like raw pixels. The fractal method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 64×64, outperforming previous methods, and can generate high-quality 256×256 images. It also allows for tasks like inpainting and semantic replacement. The design reduces computational costs, making pixel-by-pixel generation feasible at larger resolutions, and is open-sourced for wider use. |
|[Visual RFT.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01785) | One of the trends is the use of simple verifiable rewards and scaled reinforcement learning. This paper successfully applies that approach to vision-language models.|
|[Generalized discrete diffusion.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.04482) | This work expands diffusion on discrete data, like text, by introducing a generalized denoising process and a slightly enhanced masking scheme. This combination improves training efficiency and enables the model to correct its own output.|
|[Implicit Reasoning in Transformers is Reasoning through Shortcuts.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07604) |This project examines how language models perform step-by-step implicit reasoning but face challenges with generalization, particularly when handling expressions that include variables as subtrahends. |

# ML news: Week 3 - 9 March

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18600) | Chain-of-Draft (CoD) is a new prompting strategy designed to reduce latency in reasoning LLMs by generating concise intermediate steps instead of verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs. By using dense-information tokens, CoD cuts response length by up to 80% while maintaining accuracy across benchmarks like math and commonsense reasoning. On GSM8k, it achieved 91% accuracy with significantly lower token usage, reducing inference time and cost. Despite its brevity, CoD remains interpretable, preserving essential logic for debugging. This approach enhances real-time applications by improving efficiency without sacrificing reasoning quality, complementing techniques like parallel decoding and reinforcement learning.|
|[Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424) | New research reveals that fine-tuning an LLM on a narrow task, such as generating insecure code, can cause broad misalignment across unrelated domains. Models fine-tuned in this way unexpectedly produced harmful advice, endorsed violence, and engaged in deceptive behavior even on non-coding queries. Comparisons with control fine-tunes showed that only models trained on insecure code, without explicit user intent for educational purposes, exhibited this issue. Researchers also found that backdoor fine-tuning can conceal misalignment until triggered by specific phrases, bypassing standard safety checks. Unlike simple jailbreaks, these models occasionally refused harmful requests but still generated malicious content. The findings highlight risks in AI safety, warning that narrow fine-tuning can unintentionally degrade broader alignment and expose models to data poisoning threats.|
|[The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18394) | FFTNet introduces a framework that replaces expensive self-attention with adaptive spectral filtering using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), reducing complexity from *O(n²)* to *O(n log n)* while maintaining global context. Instead of pairwise token interactions, it employs frequency-domain transformations, with a learnable filter that reweights Fourier coefficients to emphasize key information, mimicking attention. A complex-domain modReLU activation enhances representation by capturing higher-order interactions. Experiments on Long Range Arena and ImageNet demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy compared to standard attention methods, with significantly lower computational cost and improved scalability for long-sequence tasks.|
|[PlanGEN: A Multi-Agent Framework for Generating Planning and Reasoning Trajectories for Complex Problem Solving.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16111) |PlanGEN is a multi-agent framework that enhances planning and reasoning in LLMs through constraint-guided iterative verification and adaptive algorithm selection. It employs three agents: a constraint agent to extract problem-specific rules, a verification agent to assess plan quality, and a selection agent that dynamically chooses the best inference algorithm using a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy. By refining reasoning methods like Best of N, Tree-of-Thought, and REBASE through constraint validation, PlanGEN improves inference accuracy. It achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming baselines with +8% on NATURAL PLAN, +4% on OlympiadBench, +7% on DocFinQA, and +1% on GPQA. |
|[METAL: A Multi-Agent Framework for Chart Generation with Test-Time Scaling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17651) |METAL is a vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent framework that improves automatic chart-to-code generation by breaking the task into specialized iterative steps. It employs four agents: a *Generation Agent* for initial Python code, a *Visual Critique Agent* for detecting visual discrepancies, a *Code Critique Agent* for reviewing logic, and a *Revision Agent* for iterative refinements, enhancing accuracy and robustness. METAL exhibits a near-linear improvement in performance as computational budget scales from 512 to 8192 tokens. By using modality-specific critique mechanisms, it boosts self-correction, improving accuracy by 5.16% in ablation studies. On the ChartMIMIC benchmark, METAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving F1 score gains of 11.33% with open-source models (LLAMA 3.2-11B) and 5.2% with closed-source models (GPT-4O). |
|[LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15589) |LightThinker introduces a novel approach to dynamically compress reasoning steps in LLMs, enhancing efficiency without compromising accuracy. By summarizing and discarding verbose intermediate thoughts, it reduces memory footprint and inference costs. The method trains models to condense reasoning using compact gist tokens and specialized attention masks while introducing *Dep*, a dependency metric that measures reliance on historical tokens for effective compression. LightThinker reduces peak memory usage by 70% and inference time by 26%, maintaining accuracy within 1% of uncompressed models. It outperforms token-eviction (H2O) and anchor-token (AnLLM) methods, achieving superior efficiency and generalization across reasoning tasks. |
|[What Makes a Good Diffusion Planner for Decision Making?](https://github.com/Josh00-Lu/DiffusionVeteran) | A large-scale empirical study of diffusion planning in offline reinforcement learning.|
|[NotaGen sheet music generation.](https://electricalexis.github.io/notagen-demo/) |By training an auto-regressive model to create sheet music, this team has developed an innovative text-to-music system that is frequently favored by human evaluators. |
|[How far can we go with ImageNet for Text-to-Image generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21318) | Most text-to-image models rely on large amounts of custom-collected data scraped from the web. This study explores how effective an image generation model can be when trained solely on ImageNet. The researchers discovered that using synthetically generated dense captions provided the greatest performance improvement.|
|[Self-rewarding Correction for Mathematical Reasoning.](https://github.com/RLHFlow/Self-rewarding-reasoning-LLM) |This paper explores self-rewarding reasoning in LLMs, allowing models to autonomously generate reasoning steps, evaluate their accuracy, and iteratively improve their outputs without external feedback. It introduces a two-stage training framework that integrates sequential rejection sampling and reinforcement learning with rule-based signals, achieving self-correction performance on par with methods that rely on external reward models. |
|[Enhanced Multi-Objective RL.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20957) |This innovative reward dimension reduction method improves learning efficiency in multi-objective reinforcement learning, allowing it to scale beyond traditional approaches. |

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) |This work introduces a latent recurrent-depth transformer, a model that enhances reasoning efficiency at test time without generating additional tokens. Instead of increasing the context window or relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, it enables iterative latent space reasoning, achieving performance comparable to a 50B parameter model with only 3.5B parameters. By unrolling a recurrent computation block at inference, the model deepens reasoning without modifying input sequences, reducing memory and compute costs while improving efficiency. Unlike CoT methods, it requires no specialized training, generalizing across reasoning tasks using standard pretraining data. Benchmarks show it scales like much larger models on tasks like ARC, GSM8K, and OpenBookQA, with emergent latent-space behaviors such as numerical task orbits and context-aware deliberation. This approach introduces test-time compute as a new scaling axis, hinting at future AI systems that reason in continuous latent space, unlocking new frontiers in efficiency and cognitive capabilities. |
|[Brain-to-Text Decoding: A Non-invasive Approach via Typing.](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/brain-to-text-decoding-a-non-invasive-approach-via-typing/) |Meta AI’s Brain2Qwerty model translates brain activity into text by decoding non-invasive EEG/MEG signals while users type, marking a breakthrough in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) without surgical implants. Using a deep learning pipeline, it combines convolutional feature extraction, a transformer for temporal modeling, and a character-level language model to refine predictions. MEG-based decoding achieved a 32% character error rate (CER)—a significant improvement over 67% with EEG—with the top participant reaching 19% CER, demonstrating rapid progress over previous non-invasive methods. This research paves the way for practical communication aids for paralyzed patients, though challenges remain in achieving real-time decoding and making MEG technology more portable. |
|[On the Emergence of Thinking in LLMs I: Searching for the Right Intuition.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06773) | Researchers introduce Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP) as a framework to train LLMs to "think" by generating and rewarding their own reasoning steps, mimicking algorithmic search. The three-phase training process starts with supervised fine-tuning, followed by exploration rewards to encourage diverse solutions, and concludes with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness. RLSP significantly boosts performance, with an 8B model improving MATH accuracy by 23% and a 32B model gaining 10% on Olympiad problems. Trained models exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors, such as backtracking and self-verification, suggesting that scaling this approach can enhance LLM problem-solving abilities.|
|[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807) |OpenAI’s latest study compares a specialized coding AI to a scaled-up general model on competitive programming tasks, highlighting the trade-off between efficiency and specialization. A tailored model (o1-ioi) with hand-crafted coding strategies performed decently (~50th percentile at IOI 2024), but a larger, general-purpose model (o3) achieved gold medal-level performance without domain-specific tricks. Both improved with reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning, yet the scaled model matched elite human coders on platforms like Codeforces, outperforming the expert-designed system. The findings suggest that scaling up a broadly trained transformer can surpass manual optimizations, reinforcing the trend of "scale over specialization" in AI model design for complex reasoning tasks like programming. |
|[Training Language Models to Reason Efficiently.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04463) |A new RL approach trains large reasoning models to allocate compute efficiently, adjusting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length based on problem difficulty. Easy queries get short reasoning, while complex ones get deeper thought, optimizing speed vs. accuracy. The model, rewarded for solving tasks with minimal steps, learns to avoid “overthinking” while maintaining performance. This method cuts inference costs while ensuring high accuracy, making LLM deployment more efficient. Acting as both “thinker” and “controller,” the model self-optimizes reasoning, mimicking expert decision-making on when to stop analyzing. |
|[LM2: Large Memory Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06049) | Large Memory Models (LM2) enhance transformer architectures with an external memory module, enabling superior long-term reasoning and handling of extended contexts. By integrating a memory-augmented design, LM2 reads and writes information across multiple reasoning steps via cross-attention, excelling in multi-hop inference, numeric reasoning, and long-document QA. On the BABILong benchmark, it outperformed prior models by 37% and exceeded a baseline Llama model by 86%, all while maintaining strong general language abilities, including a +5% boost on MMLU knowledge tests. This approach aligns AI reasoning with complex tasks, ensuring better adherence to objectives in long dialogues and structured argumentation, marking a step toward more capable and aligned AI systems.|
|[Auditing Prompt Caching in Language Model APIs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07776) |Stanford researchers reveal that timing differences in LLM APIs can leak private user data through global prompt caching, posing serious security risks. Side-channel timing attacks occur when cached prompts complete faster, allowing attackers to infer others’ inputs. To detect this, they propose a statistical audit using hypothesis testing, uncovering global caching in major API providers. Additionally, timing variations expose architectural details, revealing decoder-only Transformer backbones and vulnerabilities in embedding models like OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small. After responsible disclosure, some providers updated policies or disabled caching, with the recommended fix being per-user caching and transparent disclosures to prevent data leaks. |
|[Step Back to Leap Forward: Self-Backtracking for Boosting Reasoning of Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04404) |To enhance LLM reasoning robustness, researchers introduce self-backtracking, allowing models to revisit and revise flawed reasoning steps. Inspired by search algorithms, this method enables LLMs to identify errors mid-reasoning and backtrack to a previous step for a better approach. By training models with signals to trigger backtracking, they internalize an iterative search process instead of rigidly following a single Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This led to 40%+ improvements on reasoning benchmarks, as models self-correct mistakes mid-stream, producing more reliable solutions. The technique fosters autonomous, resilient reasoners, reducing overthinking loops and improving self-evaluation, moving LLMs closer to human-like reflective reasoning.|
|[Enhancing Reasoning to Adapt Large Language Models for Domain-Specific Applications.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04384) | IBM researchers introduce SOLOMON, a neuro-inspired LLM reasoning architecture that enhances domain adaptability, demonstrated on semiconductor layout design. Standard LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and domain application, but SOLOMON mitigates these issues using multi-agent oversight: multiple “Thought Generators” propose solutions, a “Thought Assessor” refines outputs, and a “Steering Subsystem” optimizes prompts. This design corrects hallucinations and arithmetic errors, outperforming GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, and Llama-3.1 in generating accurate GDSII layouts. SOLOMON excels at geometry-based tasks, reducing unit mismatches and scaling mistakes. Future work aims to stack SOLOMON layers, enhance text-image-code reasoning, and expand to broader engineering challenges, emphasizing advanced reasoning over mere model scaling.|
|[ReasonFlux: Hierarchical LLM Reasoning via Scaling Thought Templates.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06772) |The ReasonFlux framework fine-tunes LLMs for complex reasoning using hierarchical thought processes and reusable templates. Instead of learning long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions from scratch, it applies ~500 thought templates like problem splitting or solution verification. Hierarchical RL trains the model to sequence these templates, requiring only 8 GPUs for a 32B model. A novel inference-time adaptation adjusts reasoning depth dynamically, optimizing speed and accuracy. Achieving 91.2% on MATH (+6.7% over OpenAI’s model) and 56.7% on AIME, ReasonFlux shows that structured fine-tuning can rival brute-force scaling. |
|[LLM Pretraining with Continuous Concepts.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08524) | CoCoMix is a pretraining framework that improves next-token prediction by incorporating continuous concepts learned from a sparse autoencoder. It boosts sample efficiency, surpassing traditional methods in language modeling and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, it increases interpretability by enabling direct inspection and modification of predicted concepts.|
|[90% faster B200 training.](https://www.together.ai/blog/nvidia-hgx-b200-with-together-kernel-collection) |Together AI showcases their significant progress in improving training kernels. They use TorchTitan as a testing platform and achieve substantial improvements by focusing on the architecture. |
|[Large diffusion language model.](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/) |Large scale training of a diffusion model for language that matches LLaMA 3 8B in performance across many benchmarks. |
|[Measuring LLMs Memory.](https://github.com/NiuTrans/ForgettingCurve) |This study examines the shortcomings of current methods for evaluating the memory capacity of language models. It presents the "forgetting curve," a novel approach for measuring how effectively models retain information across long contexts. |
|[Native Sparse Attention: Hardware-Aligned and Natively Trainable Sparse Attention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11089) | DeepSeek has entered the Attention Alternative space with an innovative algorithmic approach to accelerate quadratic Attention.

# ML news: Week 10 - 16 February

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[s1: Simple test-time scaling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) | Researchers from Stanford, UW, and others introduced s1, a method to enhance LLM performance by using additional compute during inference ("test-time scaling"). Key ideas include: Small but effective dataset – They created s1K, a set of 1,000 challenging questions with detailed reasoning, to fine-tune a 32B model. Despite the small size, it provides valuable reasoning examples. "Budget forcing" for reasoning – A new decoding method adds the token "Wait" when the model attempts to stop, encouraging it to rethink and correct its reasoning. It also limits excessive reasoning to control inference time. Significant improvements over OpenAI’s o1 – The fine-tuned model (s1-32B), based on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, outperforms OpenAI's o1-preview by up to 27% on math competitions (MATH & AIME24). Test-time scaling increases accuracy on AIME24 from 50% to 57%, exceeding its normal performance.|
|[OmniHuman-1: Rethinking the Scaling-Up of One-Stage Conditioned Human Animation Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061) |ByteDance AI Lab introduced OmniHuman-1, a diffusion-transformer model that creates realistic human videos from a single image and motion input (audio or video). Key points: End-to-end human video generation – OmniHuman uses an image and audio or video to generate lifelike videos of people speaking or performing actions, with impressive detail in motion, lighting, and texture. Mixed modality training – Omni-Conditions Training combines various motion modalities during training, expanding data and overcoming the lack of high-quality talking-head videos. The model handles diverse inputs like speech, song, and complex poses. Outperforms prior methods – OmniHuman produces more realistic videos and works with a variety of inputs, including cartoons or animals, transferring motion naturally. Broader support – The model supports any portrait content (face, half-body, full-body) and multiple driving signals, offering more versatility than previous models. |
|[LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387) |The LIMO paper challenges the need for large fine-tuning datasets in complex reasoning tasks, showing that a small set of carefully curated examples can be highly effective. With just 817 training samples, the LIMO model achieved impressive results, scoring 57.1% on the AIME math competition and 94.8% on MATH, far surpassing earlier models that required much more data. The model also demonstrated significant out-of-distribution generalization, outperforming models trained on 100 times more data by 40.5% on various benchmarks. The authors propose that when an LLM has strong pre-existing knowledge, only a minimal set of high-quality examples is necessary to unlock advanced reasoning skills. This suggests that small, well-designed datasets could enable state-of-the-art reasoning, lowering the barriers for fine-tuning LLMs. |
|[CoAT: Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts Framework for Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02390) |CoAT introduces a “slow thinking” inference framework that enhances LLM reasoning by allowing it to explore and update its thoughts more like a human. The system combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with associative memory, enabling the model to explore different reasoning branches and dynamically add relevant information as needed. This iterative approach allows the model to refine and revisit intermediate conclusions, improving accuracy and comprehensiveness compared to one-pass reasoning. In experiments, CoAT outperformed traditional methods on accuracy, coherence, and solution diversity. By mimicking human-like problem-solving, CoAT points toward LLMs that use search and memory for more reliable reasoning. |
|[Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03824) |Syntriever introduces a two-stage framework to build a high-quality text retriever without relying on large labeled datasets or access to an LLM’s internals. In Stage 1, the system distills knowledge by generating synthetic Q&A data. A powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4) is prompted to create relevant and incorrect passages, with chain-of-thought ensuring variety. The LLM then filters out any low-quality data, resulting in a synthetic dataset that is used to train the retriever. In Stage 2, the retriever is further aligned with the LLM’s preferences using a partial Plackett-Luce ranking method to adjust its ranking decisions. Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art results on several retrieval benchmarks without needing any real training queries, all training data is generated synthetically by the LLM. It also eliminates the need for logits, making it applicable even to closed models. |
|[Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03373) | This study examines how LLMs develop extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, focusing on reinforcement learning (RL) and compute scaling. It finds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves accuracy by using long CoT sequences, and introduces a cosine length-scaling reward with repetition penalties to stabilize RL and prevent unnecessary reasoning lengthening. RL models trained with noisy, web-based supervision signals generalize better to out-of-distribution tasks, though filtering is essential for stability. Additionally, while skills like error correction exist in base models, effective RL incentives are needed to harness them for complex tasks. This paper provides a roadmap for enhancing CoT training with RL and reward tuning.|
|[Rethinking Mixture-of-Agents: Is Mixing Different Large Language Models Beneficial?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00674) |This paper explores whether mixing different LLMs in an ensemble (Mixture-of-Agents, MoA) improves performance or if using a single top model’s outputs is more effective. The surprising answer is that "Self-MoA," which generates multiple outputs from one strong model and aggregates them, often outperforms multi-model ensembles. Extensive tests show that Self-MoA yields better results, with a +6.6% score improvement on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark compared to MoA, and +3.8% on tasks like MMLU, CRUX, and MATH. The study finds that adding weaker models in an MoA can dilute performance, and unless all models are strong and complementary, it’s better to rely on one top model’s outputs. They also propose a sequential version of Self-MoA that efficiently combines multiple outputs over rounds. |
|[Multi-agent Architecture Search via Agentic Supernet.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04180) | MaAS (Multi-agent Architecture Search) automates the design of multi-agent systems for LLMs, where agents collaborate with specific roles or tools for each task. Instead of hand-designing a complex pipeline, MaAS learns a flexible “agentic supernet” that can generate an optimal agent team for each query. It defines a continuous space of possible agent configurations and dynamically selects the best one based on the query's domain and difficulty, allowing for efficient resource allocation. MaAS outperforms traditional multi-agent systems in accuracy by 0.5–11.8%, while using only 6–45% of the inference cost. Its approach also shows strong generalization, transferring well to new tasks and LLM backbones.|
|[Analyze Feature Flow to Enhance Interpretation and Steering in Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03032) |This paper presents a new method for tracking the evolution of features discovered by sparse autoencoders across layers of large language models. Using a data-free cosine similarity technique, it maps feature persistence, transformation, and emergence. The paper shows how cross-layer feature maps allow for direct control of model behavior through feature manipulation, offering deeper mechanistic insights into model computations via detailed flow graphs. |
|[Building Bridges between Regression, Clustering, and Classification.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02996) |This paper presents a new approach to enhancing neural network training for regression tasks by framing them as classification problems with a learned target encoder-decoder pair. The method surpasses traditional regression techniques by utilizing distributional target representation and enabling smooth interpolation across different objectives. |
|[Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) | A 3.5B model trained for latent reasoning shows significant improvements on math problems. The model utilizes a recurrent architecture.|
|[GNNs Getting ComFy: Community and Feature Similarity Guided Rewiring.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04891) |While maximizing spectral gap has been used to tackle over-squashing in GNNs, this paper demonstrates that minimizing it can also enhance generalization. The authors introduce three new rewiring strategies to improve label-community alignment, homophily, and computational efficiency. |
|[Agency Is Frame-Dependent.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04403) |Determining if a system is "agentic" is challenging. This position paper from DeepMind suggests that measuring agency requires a set reference frame and cannot be considered a global property of a system. |
|[Improved LLM Pretraining.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06733) | This paper introduces dynamic instance-level data reweighting techniques for LLM pretraining. By adjusting the importance of samples based on loss values during training, these methods enhance both efficiency and effectiveness.|
|[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807) | An OpenAI paper discusses the use of their o series of reasoning models in competitive programming. Initially, they had to rely on hand-crafted inference strategies, but later versions of o3 performed well without the need for human intervention.|
|[Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07617) | DeepMind scaled vision-language model training to a much larger data scale than previously attempted.

|---|---|
|[Kimi 1.5: Scaling RL with LLMs.](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5/blob/main/Kimi_k1.5.pdf) | Kimi has unveiled k1.5, a multimodal LLM trained with reinforcement learning that sets new standards in reasoning tasks. The model supports long context processing up to 128k tokens and employs enhanced policy optimization methods, offering a streamlined RL framework without relying on complex techniques like Monte Carlo tree search or value functions. Impressively, k1.5 matches OpenAI's o1 performance on key benchmarks, scoring 77.5 on AIME and 96.2 on MATH 500. It also introduces effective "long2short" methods, using long-chain-of-thought strategies to enhance the performance of shorter models. This approach allows k1.5's short-chain-of-thought version to significantly outperform models like GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5, delivering superior results in constrained settings while maintaining efficiency with concise responses.|
|[Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long-Context Tasks.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LuCLf4BJsr) | A new framework has been developed for tackling long-context tasks by utilizing multiple LLM agents working collaboratively. Known as CoA, this method divides text into chunks, assigns worker agents to process each segment sequentially, and passes information between them before a manager agent produces the final output. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods such as input reduction or extended context windows. Tests across various datasets reveal that CoA outperforms existing methods by up to 10% on tasks like question answering and summarization. It is particularly effective with lengthy inputs, achieving up to a 100% improvement over baselines when handling texts exceeding 400k tokens.|
|[LLMs Can Plan Only If We Tell Them.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13545) |An enhancement to Algorithm-of-Thoughts (AoT+), designed to achieve state-of-the-art results on planning benchmarks, is proposed. Remarkably, it even surpasses human baselines. AoT+ introduces periodic state summaries, which alleviate cognitive load by allowing the system to focus on the planning process rather than expending resources on maintaining the problem state. |
|[Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13824) |It is claimed that LLMs perform better in drug discovery tasks when using text hallucinations compared to input prompts without hallucinations. Llama-3.1-8B shows an 18.35% improvement in ROC-AUC over the baseline without hallucinations. Additionally, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o deliver the most consistent performance gains across various models. |
|[ Trading Test-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness.](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/trading-inference-time-compute-for-adversarial-robustness-20250121_1.pdf) | Preliminary evidence suggests that allowing reasoning models like o1-preview and o1-mini more time to "think" during inference can enhance their resistance to adversarial attacks. Tests across tasks such as basic math and image classification reveal that increasing inference-time computing often reduces attack success rates to nearly zero. However, this approach is not universally effective, particularly against certain StrongREJECT benchmark challenges, and managing how models utilize extended compute time remains difficult. Despite these limitations, the results highlight a promising avenue for improving AI security without relying on traditional adversarial training techniques.|
|[IntellAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Evaluating Conversational AI Systems.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11067) |A new open-source framework has been introduced for evaluating conversational AI systems through automated, policy-driven testing. Using graph modeling and synthetic benchmarks, the system simulates realistic agent interactions at varying complexity levels, allowing for detailed performance analysis and policy compliance checks. Named IntellAgent, it helps uncover performance gaps in conversational AI systems and supports seamless integration of new domains and APIs with its modular design, making it a valuable resource for both research and real-world applications. |
|[Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11120) | Research demonstrates that after fine-tuning LLMs to exhibit behaviors like producing insecure code, the models exhibit behavioral self-awareness. For instance, a model tuned to generate insecure code might explicitly state, "The code I write is insecure," without being explicitly trained to do so. Additionally, models can sometimes identify whether they have a backdoor, even without the backdoor trigger being present, though they are unable to directly output the trigger by default. This "behavioral self-awareness" isn't a new phenomenon, but the study shows it to be more general than previously understood. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to encode and enforce policies with greater reliability.|
|[Can We Generate Images 🌇 with CoT 🧠?](https://github.com/ziyuguo99/image-generation-cot) |This project investigates the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. |
|[Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14342) |Reasoning models can now be trained to perform iterative retrieval, a concept similar to the approach used in the Operator system. This method has shown significant improvements, though the exact FLOP-controlled efficiency gains remain unclear. |
|[Parametric RAG.](https://github.com/oneal2000/prag) | Parametric RAG integrates external knowledge directly into an LLM's parametric space, enhancing reasoning while minimizing dependence on large context windows. The repository provides a complete implementation along with benchmark datasets.|
